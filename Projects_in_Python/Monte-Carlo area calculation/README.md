## Calculating ratio of black pixels in a black-and-white image using Monte-Carlo-simulation

### How it works : 
  Using random sampling of pixels in the image, we find the ratio of black pixels to white pixels and hence calculate numnber of black pixels in that image.
  This is done for different numer of iterations (like 1000,10000...) and we get more and more precise answers.
